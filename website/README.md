No one reads my comments or really listens to me, so maybe another README will help? 

- String Code:echo "Height: " . $row["height"] . " m Speed: " . $row["speed"] . " m/s <br>
- Float Parsing:echo json_encode(floatval($row["height"]));

- Performs 3 Ajax calls to parse in the 3 columns (ReadHeight, ReadTemp, ReadSpeed) into table
- Read2 is back up of php calls 

Hopes this documenntation helps as the team wants for me to code and Alec to get annoyed with me even though my friend died and my grandma is sick, so I might have to leave soon.
