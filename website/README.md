Since comments and verbal notes are easily forgetten in chaos, I made a read me.  

- String Code:echo "Height: " . $row["height"] . " m Speed: " . $row["speed"] . " m/s <br>
- Float Parsing:echo json_encode(floatval($row["height"]));

- Performs 3 Ajax calls to parse in the 3 columns (ReadHeight, ReadTemp, ReadSpeed) into table through 3 setInterval functions
- Read2 is back up of php calls 

Hopes this documenntation helps as the team wants for me to code and Alec to get annoyed with me even though my friend died and my grandma is sick, so I might have to leave soon.
