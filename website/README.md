No one reads my comments or really listens to me, so maybe another README will help? 

- String Code:echo "Height: " . $row["height"] . " m Speed: " . $row["speed"] . " m/s <br>"
- Float Parsing:echo json_encode(floatval($row["height"]));

- Performs 3 Ajax calls to parse in the 3 columns (ReadHeight, ReadTemp, ReadSpeed) into table
- Read2 is back up of php calls 

Hopes this documenntation helps as I spent the past 3 semesters wanting to kill myself,
and all the team wants is for me to code and Alec to get annoyed with me.
